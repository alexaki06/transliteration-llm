# Pages Directory

This directory is reserved for future Streamlit multi-page app features.

Currently, the app uses tabs within the main app.py file.

If you want to expand to multi-page navigation in the future, 
add Python files here and they'll appear automatically in Streamlit's page navigation.

Example structure:
```
pages/
├── 1_📚_Learn.py       # Learning resources
├── 2_🔧_Tools.py       # Additional tools
└── 3_📊_Analytics.py   # Usage analytics
```
